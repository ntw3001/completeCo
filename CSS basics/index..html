  <h2>Fuck!</h2>

  <p class="cursetext">Hocus pocus, become a shrew, I curse you to become a shrew. When you wake up you'll be a shrew, that's the curse I place on you. You'll eat bugs and you'll drink water, you already do drink water. But the bugs, that part will suck, digging beetles out of muck. Gnawing through a shiny shell, to find a bitter taste as well. Shrews must have a terrid life, plus I'll cut you with a knife.</p>
